    <h1>Node Module</h1>
    <p>Node module is a block of code that we can import and use in our code.It is reusable and prevents writing long files.We can create our own module , it can also be installed using npm available third party libraries they are also available in node(pre installed).When we install some package module is installed in folder named node module/.</p>

    <h2>Module system</h2>
    <p>In the begining when node js was created there was no module system for developers.Module system means to split , reuse  and import module.</p>
    <h3>Commonjs</h3>
    <p>Commonjs is a module system that was created to solve the problem of spliting sharing and reusing code.It used <code>require</code> to import module in code.It works in synchronous way.As in the begining there was no modules system so nodejs used commonjs as native module system.It does not work with browsers.</p>
    <h3>Ecmascript (ES6)</h3>
    <P>Later on Ecmascript was introduced as a new module system.It uses <code>import/export</code> to use module on server side.It works asynchronously.It also works with browser.It is supported with modern nodejs but commonjs also works with node because millions of packages are in commonjs.</P>
    <ul>Types of exports in ES6</ul>
    <li>Named export
        <p>These exports use name to export value of the function , variable , object etc.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Default export
        <p>It export the whole object or function or variable itself by default. we use <code>default</code>
        in code to expoprt.</p>
    </li>
    <h3>Variables in CommonJs</h3>
    <p>In nodejs writing module in commonjs the node wrap in the code in below function by default.
        <code>
            (function(exports ,require, module, __dirname, __filename){

            })
        </code>
        And the variables come from this function.Require io used to fetch the module.__dirname is used to show directory.__filename is used to diplay file name.All these are available in that function.
